# pixaxe08M2

In answer  to Bryan Cairns of void void realms as promised
For other Facebook  users  I would  have included  this on twitter   but unfortunately twitter are a set of  power crazy loons  who don't appreciate decent input neither do they have a sense  of  which is their loss not mine 
Ive also put this together for others interested  in learning embedded technologies 
and its ideal  for  schools ,  colleges  and universities 
You will need Kicad installed  which can be  found  with most  distributions  of open-source  Linux operating systems 
You will also need to run the Gerber  plots yourself  but all  tutorials can be found on U tube relating to this 

Its an excellent opening for  many to start manufacturing from  home in any country of the world  of which  most of this  can be done  by hand so Ive  made this easy as I can for you  and at better quality than  Pic axe   supply this  very basic board and at fraction of  price 

Many of theses components you could  find from scrap eg the  connectors etc but most of these components can be found  online  via eBay  and other major suppliers  apart from the  08M2 cpu 

RS components or CPC supply these
